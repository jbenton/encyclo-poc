<a href="http://mediabugs.org/">MediaBugs</a> is a service that facilitates the discovery and correction of factual errors and other problems in media coverage. HERE I AM MAKING A CHANGE.

MediaBugs is funded by the <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/encyclo/knight-foundation/">Knight Foundation</a> by way of the <a href="http://www.newschallenge.org/">Knight News Challenge</a>, which <a href="http://www.newschallenge.org/winner/2009/mediabugs">awarded the project $335,000</a> in 2009. MediaBugs is directed by <a href="http://www.wordyard.com/">Scott Rosenberg</a>, an author and a co-founder of <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/encyclo/salon/">Salon</a>, along with former Salon editor <a href="http://markfollman.com/about/">Mark Follman</a>.

Some of the project's <a href="http://mediabugs.org/pages/intro">goals</a> include giving the public tools to report errors and problems they find in media coverage, across print, broadcast, and the web; helping to get those errors corrected by way of a "civil, productive discussion of them between journalists and the public"; helping journalists by organizing and filtering the reporting of errors; tracking data on errors and corrections for public use; and improving communication between the media and the public in hopes of giving the public more confidence in the news.

<!--more-->In April 2010, the MediaBugs project <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/04/mediabugs-the-knight-funded-error-tracker-launches-its-public-beta/">launched its website in public beta</a>, with an initially tight focus on error correction among the media outlets of the San Francisco Bay Area. In October of that year, as part of a broader site redesign, MediaBugs <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/10/mediabugs-revamps-its-site-with-a-new-national-focus/">extended its purview</a> to include a more national focus.
